# Knowledge Base

This folder contains all the documents that the chatbot can reference.

## How to Add More Documents

1. **Create or copy markdown files** into this folder
2. Files should be in `.md` (Markdown) format
3. The chatbot will automatically load ALL `.md` files from this folder
4. Restart the Streamlit app to load new files

## File Organization Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `waggener-demographics.md`, `funding-sources.md`, etc.
- Keep related information in separate files for easier updates
- Use markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content within files

## Example Files to Add

- `dual-credit-research.md` - Kentucky dual credit program info (already added)
- `foundation-research.md` - Information about foundations
- `waggener-info.md` - Details about Waggener High School
- `college-now-program.md` - College NoW program specifics
- `grant-templates.md` - Grant writing templates and tips

## Current Files

The chatbot will show which files are loaded in the sidebar.
