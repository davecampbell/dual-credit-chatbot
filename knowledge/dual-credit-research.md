# Kentucky Dual Credit Program - Background & Research

## Executive Summary

Kentucky's Dual Credit initiative allows high school students to earn both high school and college credit simultaneously through college-level courses. The program has grown dramatically from 23,307 students in 2014-15 to 40,821 students in 2019-20 (a 75% increase), and is supported by comprehensive state policy, scholarship funding, and coordination among multiple educational agencies.

## What is Dual Credit?

### Official Definition

According to **KRS 158.007(8)**, dual credit is defined as:

> "A college-level course of study developed in accordance with KRS 164.098 in which a high school student receives credit from both the high school and postsecondary institution in which the student is enrolled upon completion of a single class or designated program of study."

### How It Works

**Course Delivery:**
- Classes occur in multiple settings: high schools, Area Technology Centers, Career/Tech Centers, college campuses, and online
- Students follow college policies and deadlines regardless of course location
- Courses are taught by qualified instructors meeting college credentialing requirements

**Credit Earned:**
- Students receive both high school credit AND college credit for the same course
- College credits are permanently recorded on a college transcript
- Grades count toward the student's college GPA from day one

**Types of Courses:**
1. **General Education Dual Credit** - Academic courses (English, math, history, sciences, etc.) that transfer to meet university general education requirements
2. **Career and Technical Education (CTE) Dual Credit** - Technical courses aligned to workforce pathways and career certifications

## How Kentucky's Dual Credit Program Works

### Student Eligibility & Admission

**Minimum Requirements (13 KAR 2:020):**
- **Unweighted cumulative high school GPA of at least 2.5** on a 4.00 scale
- Meet any college course prerequisite established by the institution
- Maintain college minimum GPA standards once enrolled

**Grade Levels:**
- General education dual credit: Primarily grades 11-12 (some exceptions)
- CTE dual credit: Grades 9-12

### Course Quality & Transfer

**Instructor Qualifications:**
- Dual credit instructors must meet the same credentialing requirements as college faculty
- Courses follow the same learning outcomes and assessments as on-campus college courses

**Transfer Policy:**
- Kentucky colleges and universities **must recognize courses** meeting state general education requirements
- Career and technical courses must align with specific learning outcomes and program requirements for transfer
- Credits are permanent on college transcript and count toward GPA

### Cost Structure

**Tuition Rates:**
- Dual credit courses charged at reduced rate: **$91 per credit hour** (approximately half of KCTCS regular tuition)
- Example: 3-credit course = $273 per student
- Compare to regular KCTCS tuition: ~$182 per credit hour
- Compare to four-year university tuition: $300-$500+ per credit hour

**Who Pays:**
- **General Education Dual Credit (grades 11-12):** KHEAA Dual Credit Scholarship covers tuition (up to 2 courses)
- **CTE Dual Credit (grades 9-12):** Work Ready Kentucky Scholarship covers tuition (up to 2 courses per year)
- **Additional Costs:**
  - Textbooks and course materials (may be covered by school district, or student/family responsibility)
  - Fees (varies by institution and course)
  - Courses beyond scholarship limits (paid by student/family)

**Funding Gap - The Sophomore Challenge:**
This is where the **Sophomore Scholars Program** addresses a critical need:
- Freshmen: Often supported by local organizations (e.g., Goshen Rotary at Waggener)
- Sophomores: **Limited scholarship eligibility** (CTE dual credit available, but general education scholarships prioritize juniors/seniors)
- Juniors & Seniors: Full access to both General Dual Credit and Work Ready scholarships

Many sophomores taking general education dual credit fall into a **funding gap**, especially when taking more than 2 courses or courses not covered by existing scholarships.

### Program Growth & Enrollment

**Historical Growth:**
- 2014-15: **23,307 students** taking dual credit
- 2019-20: **40,821 students** taking dual credit
- **75% increase** in five years

**Current Participation:**
- 422 dual credit classes taken at Waggener High School (2023)
- 218 distinct students enrolled in dual credit at Waggener (2023)

## Research & Demonstrated Outcomes

## Connection to Waggener High School's College NoW Program

### College NoW Overview

### The Sophomore Funding Gap at Waggener

**Existing Support:**

- **Juniors & Seniors:** State scholarship programs (General Dual Credit Scholarship, Work Ready Scholarship) cover up to 4 classes
- **Sophomores:** **No dedicated funding source** for general education dual credit

**Why This Matters:**
- Sophomores are often overlooked (attention gap between freshman transition and junior/senior college prep)
- Early dual credit exposure (sophomore year) builds momentum for continued success
- Financial barriers prevent participation for students from low-income families (73% free/reduced lunch at Waggener)
- Sophomore year is when students are academically ready but lack funding options

**Sophomore Scholars Program Response:**
- WHSAA commits $10,000 annually
- Seeks foundation support to cover remaining ~$30,000 annual unmet need
- Serves approximately 50 sophomore students annually
- Ensures equitable access to College NoW regardless of family financial resources
