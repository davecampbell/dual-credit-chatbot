# SOPHOMORE SCHOLARS PROGRAM
## Waggener High School Alumni Association

### PROGRAM OVERVIEW
The Sophomore Scholars Program is the primary pathway for WHS Alumni to provide meaningful academic support to current Waggener students. The Alumni Association funds nearly all the "unmet need" of College NoW Dual-Credit courses for the entire sophomore class on an ongoing basis.

### WHAT IS COLLEGE NoW?
College NoW is a challenging academic program that enables WHS students to earn **more than 30 college credit hours** while in high school through partnerships with:
- University of Louisville (UofL)
- University of Kentucky (UofK)
- Western Kentucky University (WKU)
- Campbellsville University
- Jefferson Community & Technical College (JCTC)
- Bellarmine University

Courses are college-level classes taught by college staff across subjects including English, mathematics, history, sciences, psychology, communication, and more.

### WHO BENEFITS?
- **~60 sophomore students annually** from two Academies: Health Science and IT & Law
- Each academy section has approximately 30 students
- Students earn college credits that reduce their future educational costs
- Particularly impactful for first-generation college-bound students

### FINANCIAL COMMITMENT
- Dual-credit courses cost **$100 per credit hour per student**
- Example: World History 102 (3 credits) = $300 per student
- Total annual unmet need: **$15,000**
- WHSAA minimum commitment: **$10,000** (supporting Spring 2026 sophomores)

### WHY SOPHOMORES?
State funding (Career Tech Ed and General Ed grants) covers Juniors and Seniors. Prospect/Goshen Rotary supports Freshmen. The Alumni Association fills the critical sophomore funding gap.

### PROVEN IMPACT
- Students in dual-credit programs attend college at **higher rates** than those who don't
- Enter college with previously earned credits, **reducing financial burden**
- Verified pathway to higher education and college preparedness

### IMPACT ON WHSAA SCHOLARSHIPS
- The Sophomore Scholars program has no direct impact on the traditional WHSAA Scholarships
- WHSAA Scholarships is a separate program targeting graduating seniors and uses a distinct funding channel
